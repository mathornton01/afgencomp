# Afgencomp: An R-Package for Alignment-Free Genetic Comparison (Previously `YinGenomicDFTDistance`). 

This repository contains a software distribution of an R-Package, Afgencomp, which contains utility functions for comparing string representations of 
genomic sequences, without having to perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA, an often timely and expensive step).  The package contains documented 
functions which allow the user to:
