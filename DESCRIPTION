Title: Alignment Free Genetic Comparisons

Description: The original code below is from a previous version of the afgencomp package 
  which was hosted under the name 'YinGenomicDFT'.  The code was captured from 
  Github on 12-14-2021, but was originally dated April 2021.  The summary ' A
  Translation of Much of the DFT Distance Framework into an R-Package ' was 
  given as the primary purpose of the package was indeed to implement an R 
  version of the MatLab package created by Yin and Yau (2021) for the same 
  purpose. 
    The software included herein is intended to be useful in providing quick 
  distance calculations for genomic sequences based on a few alignment-free 
  approaches, specifically (as of now) the K-mer frequency vector distance, and 
  the Fourier transform Power and Phase Spectral Distances.
